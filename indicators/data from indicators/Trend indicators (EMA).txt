if the slope of the Regression line is +15(d) degres  with 5(p) points of accuracy
its increasing, so buy

if the slope of the regression line is -15(d) degres with 5(p) points of accuracy
its decreasing, so sell

cancel positions when its facing 5(e) degrees the other direction

test run with a 1 hour EMA at 15 minute time interval:
1500 2/15 124
