It appears to be closlely related to sell price

if EMA is 1.5(n) pips above sellPrice for 3(m) durations then sell (its going down)
	continue until EMA is 1pip(l) below the the sell price

if EMA is 1.5(n) pips below sellPrice for 3(m) durations then buy (its going up)
	conintue until EMA is 1pip(l) above the sellPrice

n, m, and l are from the data list passed to market to allow the multithreader to brute force
good solutions
note - should also have a variable length EMA but we'll just use a EMA with length 4
and a time frame of 15 minutes, 4*15 = 60 minute EMA
note - how much to buy/sell (assuming 10% of account now, will brute force later to see)

multithreading test with 800 tries
1< n, m, l < 10
best n,m,l: .0001, 20, .0007

Changed pip spread to a realistic amount, 2pips
best, n,m,l: .0001, 50, .0025
ema: 34 timefrace is 15 minutes
-note doesn't work very good throughout the year

now testing with differing time frame.
with a 1 day time frame it still doesn't make much money


RESULTS:
apparently deciding to buy when the EMA is above/below is a bad idea
im going to attempt to use the EMA as a trend indicator - if its trending down then short, if its
trending up then buy
